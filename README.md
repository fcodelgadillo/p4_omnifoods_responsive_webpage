A responsive web page with a professional look


This project was part of an extensive course for personal update about HTML, JS and CSS.
It is a responsive web page about a fictitious company that delivers meals. The principal objective was to achieve a professional
look even when there is not enough functionality to make it a production ready app. But with a little more work it could easily
match and outperform commercial pages already active online.
